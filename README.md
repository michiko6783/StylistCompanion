# StylistCompanion
This application is intended to assist stylists in helping a client select styles appropriate for them. Instead of imagining what a style or color looks like on them this would be used to take a picture of them in a controled setting and placing different styles on them for a more realistic, real-time visual. 

CSS grid was implemented to arrange everything in it's column and rows with more ease. 
The camera is accessed so that a snapshot can be taken. At this time the camera continues to view, though can be hidden under than canvas, though when that is attempted the camera view is then hidden completely even before snapshot is taken.

The areas for selections would include styles, color and texture(amount of curl). At this point the styles page is the only available. The styles placed in the styles section were selected from images online then cropped to remove all background and model image. This is to achieve the ability to place just the hairstyle over the client's image. 

The images are then resized to fit the canvas area over the snapshot. Though they only sit in the position they did in their original, eventually I would like to able to place them where needed.

Eventually the styles should be able to zoom in/out to size to the client's image and face shape, as well as changing length of the style instead of having seperate images of the same style in different lengths. 

For the color page I would have the same style selections but with the ability to have a RGB filter for just the hair portion so that you can see what the color would like on the client versus a color swatch out of a book.

The texture page would have multiple texture styles with the same ability of lengthening the look by scale bar.
